Version 0.0-07
2014-02-13
   - Maintenance release to reflect the changes in PowerTOST V1.1-10.
   - Contains now the function power.2stage.GS() for non-adaptive group
     sequential (2-stage) BE studies.
Version 0.0-06
2014-01-02 
   - Examples adapted to to complain with CRAN policy "Examples should run for 
     no more than a few seconds each". Few means below 5 sec as I learned.
     Attention! Number of sims are too low to have meaningfull results.
     Minimum number of sims should be 1E5 for 'power', 1E6 sims for 'alpha'.
Version 0.0-05
2013-12-27 
   - First attempt to release via CRAN
Version 0.0-04
2013-09-12 not released, internal version only
   - Function power2.2stage() renamed to power.2stage.KM()
   - Arguments in power.2stage.KM() omitted which are not necessary for
     the TSD's described in the Karalis & Macheras and in Karalis papers 
     (see references).
   - Default method in power.2stage.KM() shifted to "C".
   - Function power.2stage.Bf() implemented which evaluates a 2-stage design
     derived from Potvin method 'B' with a futility criterion for the PE
     of stage 1.
Version 0.0-03
2013-09-03 released to alpha testers
   - function power2.2stage() implemented which uses PE and MSE of stage 1
     also for the power calculation steps if usePE=TRUE
Version 0.0-02
2013-07-10 released to alpha testers
   - Default for npct argument changed to c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95) in accordance
     with the Potvin papers.
   - Cases with n(total)>Nmax now counted at stage 1 since I feel this is more
     logical.
   - More checks of input added (THX to Helmut Schuetz).
   - Bug in output removed claiming that sample size is estimated with PE 
     & mse from stage 1 even if argument usePE=FALSE (THX to Helmut).
   - Internally stage vector introduced and output based on that.
version 0.0-01
2013-07-09
